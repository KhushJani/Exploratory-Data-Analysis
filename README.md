# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) makes it simpler for data scientists to find patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, or verify assumptions by determining how to change data sources to achieve the answers they need. EDA helps with a better understanding of the variables in the data collection and their relationships, and is usually used to investigate what data might disclose beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing assignment. It can also assist in determining the suitability of the statistical methods you are considering using for data analysis.

EDA's major goal is to encourage data analysis before making any assumptions. It can assist in finding glaring errors, better understanding data patterns, spotting outliers or unusual occurrences, and discovering intriguing relationships between the variables.

<h3> Primary types of EDA: </h3>

single-variate non-graphical This is the most basic type of data analysis because there is just one variable included in the data. It doesn't deal with causes or relationships because it only has one variable. Univariate analysis' primary goals are to characterise the data and identify any patterns that may be present.

Non-graphical multivariate data: Multivariate data is made up of multiple variables. Cross-tabulation or statistics are typically used in multivariate non-graphical EDA approaches to indicate the relationship between two or more variables of the data.Graphical representations of multivariate data are used to show the connections between two or more types of data. The most common type of graph is a grouped bar plot or bar chart, where each group corresponds to a particular level of one of the variables and each bar within a group to a particular level of the other variable.
